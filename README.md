# LANCER: NPCs Rebaked Structure Rules

This is a module for [Lancer](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf-free) on [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) that implements alternate structure/stress rules from Lancer: NPCs Rebaked by Kai Tave. These rules are currently in playtesting, and you can find the drafts on [this thread in Pilot NET](https://discord.com/channels/426286410496999425/1334655875679260692). 

Original structure rules are still in place for PCs, and for NPCs that have the Ultra template!
